- Persistent storage of objects using JSON files.
- Implementing basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for User and other classes.
- Implementing a model for the User class that stores attributes like email, password, first name, and last name.

## Setup

### Requirements:
- Python 3.8 or higher.
- A text editor or IDE for writing Python code.

### Installation:
